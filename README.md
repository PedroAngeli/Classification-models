# An experimental comparison of classification algorithms

A Machine learning project using classification algorithms. Developed in my AI classes.

## Overview

The goal of the project was to compare four different ensembles: Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest and Heterogeneous Pooling. The last one was implemented in the project and is composed of Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision tree and use majority voting to decide the outcome. The datasets used in this approach were the sets made available by the scikit-learn's library: iris, breast-cancer, and wine.
